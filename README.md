# Project_1
In this project, we analyze a dataset from a 2014 survey that examines attitudes towards mental health and the frequency of mental health disorders - specifically within the tech industry. The dataset provides insights into the mental health landscape within the tech industry, shedding light on employee perceptions, experiences, and challenges related to mental well-being. We used Python for data analysis and to explore explore trends, visualize key findings, and draw meaningful conclusions from the survey data. Our goal is to contribute to a better understanding of mental health issues in the tech sector.
